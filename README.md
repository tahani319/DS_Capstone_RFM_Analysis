# DS_Capstone_RFM_Analysis

### Description:

This is a repository of my Capstone project that I worked on as part of immersive data science course with Misk Academy.

#### RFM :


RFM represents a strategy for understanding and analyzing your customers based on three factors: Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value.
RFM model is a proven marketing strategy based on customer behavior segmentation. It groups customers based on their purchase history â€“ how recently, with what frequency and of what value did they buy.

 
RFM segmentation allows to target specific clusters of customers with communications that are much more relevant for their particular behavior, and  generate much higher rates of response, increased loyalty and customer lifetime value.


#### Business Goal:


##### We aim to build RFM model to segement the Customers based on purchase behavior so that the company can target 
##### its customers efficiently.



### Dataset descriptions: 

I used in my project dataset from the UCI machine learning repository http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail

  #####  Data Set Information:

This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.


It contains 541909 observations and 8 attributes which are fully described below:

InvoiceNo: Invoice number. Nominal, a 6-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each transaction. If this code starts with letter 'c', it indicates a cancellation.
StockCode: Product (item) code. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each distinct product.
Description: Product (item) name. Nominal.
Quantity: The quantities of each product (item) per transaction. Numeric.
InvoiceDate: Invice Date and time. Numeric, the day and time when each transaction was generated.
UnitPrice: Unit price. Numeric, Product price per unit in sterling.
CustomerID: Customer number. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each customer.
Country: Country name. Nominal, the name of the country where each customer resides.

### flow of the project 

 we are going to process and analyze a dataset for a non-store online retail. 
 The complete details of each step is provided inside the notebooks. The summary of this project is as follows:

*  Data wrangling and preprocessing.

* EDA and data visualization.
 
* RFM model to segment customers based on their purchase behaviour. 


### Implementation

This project was done in python using jupyter notebook
